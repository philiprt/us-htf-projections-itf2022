# United States High-Tide Flooding Projections

This is an update to the code base for [Thompson et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-021-01077-8), which includes:
- Updating the sea-level-rise scenarios to [2022 Sea Level Rise Technical Report](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/sealevelrise/sealevelrise-tech-report.html) for the United States.
- Refactoring how the results are formatted and stored to support the [NASA Flooding Analysis Tool](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/flooding-analysis-tool/)
